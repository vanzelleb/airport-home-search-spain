# Airport driving distance visualizer

This is an example implementation of the Mapbox and Amadeus APIs based on the Nuxt.js framework. All you need to run it is to setup the following API secrets in your environment variables:

- AMADEUS_APIKEY
- AMADEUS_APISECRET
- MAPBOX_ACCESSTOKEN

There is also a codesandbox template you can use right away. The API secrets need to be setup in the Server Control Panel.

# Serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# Build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# Generate static project

```
